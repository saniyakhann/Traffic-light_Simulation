# Traffic-light_Simulation


The timer-based traffic light system operates on a fixed schedule, alternating between green and red lights at predetermined intervals. This method does not consider the actual traffic density on each lane, leading to potential inefficiencies. In the code, constants GREEN_DURATION and RED_DURATION are set to define the duration of green and red lights in seconds, while SIMULATION_DURATION sets the total simulation time. The TrafficLightTimer class keeps track of the total wait times and the number of cars passed for both lanes. The timer_traffic_light method simulates the traffic light for a given lane, alternating between green and red states based on the fixed durations. During the green light, a random number of cars are assumed to pass through the intersection, while the wait time for the lane increases during the red light. The start_timer_based_system method creates and starts two threads, one for each lane, running the timer_traffic_light method. It waits for both threads to finish and returns the total wait times and the number of cars passed for each lane. An instance of TrafficLightTimer is created, and the start_timer_based_system method is called to start the simulation. The results are printed, showing the total wait times and the number of cars passed for each lane.

On the other hand, the AI-based traffic light system dynamically adjusts the traffic light based on the current traffic density on each lane, aiming to reduce overall wait times and increase the number of cars passing through the intersection by making decisions based on real-time traffic conditions. In this code, constants GREEN_DURATION, RED_DURATION, and SIMULATION_DURATION are similarly defined. The TrafficLightAI class initializes the traffic densities for both lanes and keeps track of the total wait times and the number of cars passed for each lane. The ai_traffic_light method simulates the AI-based traffic light system. At the beginning of each cycle, it compares the traffic densities of both lanes and gives the green light to the lane with higher traffic density, allowing more cars to pass. The traffic densities are updated to reflect cars passing and new cars arriving, and the wait time for the red light lane is incremented. The start_ai_based_system method creates and starts a thread to run the ai_traffic_light method, waits for the thread to finish, and returns the total wait times and the number of cars passed for each lane. An instance of TrafficLightAI is created, and the start_ai_based_system method is called to start the simulation. The results are printed, showing the total wait times and the number of cars passed for each lane.

By running both simulations, you can compare the efficiency of the timer-based system and the AI-based system. The AI-based system should demonstrate lower wait times and a higher number of cars passed, indicating better efficiency in managing traffic flow based on real-time conditions. This comparison highlights the advantages of using AI to dynamically adjust traffic lights in response to actual traffic conditions, resulting in improved traffic flow and reduced congestion
